First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰


## How Can You Contribute?

- Reporting Bugs
- Suggesting Enhancements
- Writing Code (Fixes, Features, Documentation)
- Improving Documentation
- Adding Tests


## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   

## Building the Project

To build the project, you'll need Docker and Docker Compose installed. The project uses a multi-container setup for development, testing, and deployment.

1. Build and start the Docker containers:
    ```sh
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
2. The above command will initiate the build process, start the necessary services, and run tests.


## Running Tests

To ensure your changes don't break existing functionality, run the tests:

1. Start the `unit-tests` service:
    ```sh
    docker-compose run unit-tests
    ```
2. Check the test results and make sure all tests pass before submitting your changes.


## Adding New Examples or Tests
1. **Examples:** Add new examples to the `cpp-lambda/examples` directory. Ensure each example has its own `CMakeLists.txt` file and a README explaining how to build and run the example.
2. **Tests:** Add new tests to the `cpp-lambda/tests` directory. Follow the existing structure and use the Google Test framework for writing unit tests.


## Committing Your Changes

1. Stage your changes:
    ```sh 
    git add .
    ```
2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
    ```sh 
    git commit -m "Add feature XYZ"
    ```

3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
    ```sh 
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```


## Creating a Pull Request

1. Navigate to the original repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "New pull request" button.
3. Select the branch you just pushed to.
4. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request.
5. Submit the pull request.
